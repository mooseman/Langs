 ***  README - toySQL *** 

 Last update - 14th Jan 2017.  

Small public-domain lexers for a very small subset of the 
SQL language. 

NOTE - All known lexing problems with toysql_file.c have 
now been fixed. It now lexes the test file sql.txt as 
expected. 

I found that using mutually-recursive functions for the 
original lexer made the lexer MUCH easier to think about 
and to code. 
It is also much easier to maintain, having separate 
"sub-lexer" functions rather than putting all lexing 
code into one huge function (as the file version does). 

I hope to do a *parser* soon.  

It was very satisfying to get this working. So much so that I want 
to do one or two lexers and parsers for other small "toy" languages 
soon. 
 
This is (of course) "public domain".   
"Share and enjoy".......  :)
