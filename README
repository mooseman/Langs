 ***  README - toySQL *** 

 Last update - 5th Mar 2018.  


I've decided to go with ANTLR4 to take toySQL further. 
It will make things a lot easier.   

Acknowledgement - A big "thanks" to Github users bkiers (who 
wrote "tiny-language-antlr4") and "mateiw" (who wrote 
"littlebasic"). I will be using grammar code from both of 
those projects. It will be very useful as I build up the  
toySQL grammar. 
Thanks to both of you for writing those apps and for 
releasing them as "public domain"!  


***************************
To compile - enter the toySQL directory and 
type these commands -   

$ antlr4 toySQL.g4

$ javac toySQL*.java

$ grun toySQL statement -gui 

( You might get a warning here -  
"Warning: TestRig moved to org.antlr.v4.gui.TestRig; calling automatically"  
Ignore it. )  

Type a SQL "select" statement like one of the following - 

select foo, bar ,baz from mytable;  

select foo, 42 as answer, baz as whatever from mytable;  

select foo, "test" as mystring, bar from mytable;  

Press ENTER then Ctrl-D. The Parse Tree Inspector should appear.   


***************************


I still need to add the "where" and "case" clauses and 
joins to the grammar. 
 
This is (of course) "public domain".   
"Share and enjoy".......  :)
