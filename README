 Last update - 9th Jan 2017.  

This is a small public-domain lexer for a very small subset of the 
SQL language. 

I found that using mutually-recursive functions for this made the 
lexer MUCH easier to think about and to code. It is also much 
easier to maintain, having separate "sub-lexer" functions rather 
than putting all lexing code into one huge function.    

I hope to do a *parser* soon.  

It was very satisfying to get this working. So much so that I want 
to do one or two lexers and parsers for other small "toy" languages 
soon. 
 
This is (of course) "public domain".   
"Share and enjoy".......  :)
