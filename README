 ***  README - toySQL *** 

 Last update - 12th Jan 2017.  

Small public-domain lexers for a very small subset of the 
SQL language. 

NOTE - the version of the code that reads from a file - 
toysql_file.c - still has a few problems with string and 
punctuation handling but they are being worked on.

I found that using mutually-recursive functions for the 
original lexer made the lexer MUCH easier to think about 
and to code. 
It is also much easier to maintain, having separate 
"sub-lexer" functions rather than putting all lexing 
code into one huge function (as the file version does). 

I hope to do a *parser* soon.  

It was very satisfying to get this working. So much so that I want 
to do one or two lexers and parsers for other small "toy" languages 
soon. 
 
This is (of course) "public domain".   
"Share and enjoy".......  :)
