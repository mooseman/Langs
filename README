 ***  README - toySQL *** 

 This will be a small public-domain SQL parser for a very small subset of the 
SQL language (just the "select" clause and probably only even part of that). 

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT - This project will use the excellent lexer and parser code 
from Dale Weiler's public-domain "LICE" compiler here - 
http://gmqcc.qc.to/cgit/cgit.cgi/LICE.git/tree/  

Very many thanks to Dale for releasing that compiler as "public domain". 
 
 
So -  "share and enjoy".......  :)
